# PythonFlaskSillyNameGeneratot
A Python Web App that displays randomly picked names.

This web app is a spin off of a python project from the book "Impractical Python Projects". The name generator in the book stores the name from a static variable in the code and the user interface is a console. This project takes that concept and takes it a little further. The names are stored in a SQLite database and the user interaction is done through a web page loaded by Flask.
